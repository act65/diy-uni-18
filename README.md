Some courses I plan on doing/have done.

### Motivation

Designing these courses helps me clear my head. For example it allows me to;
* focus on the important questions, 
* allocate time for investigating an idea, aka the ability to say not now,
* practice self-guided investigation, aka research,
* ?

Not to mention that local universities do not teach most of this stuff. This is an attempt to make up for the failures of tertiary (and before) education. In the idea case, they would have asked me to design my own course and guided me through it. Teaching me how to do research, deal with uncertainty, ask interesting questions, value the foundational work already done, ...

### Content and focus

A broad and deep view of each topic. Not necessarily focusing on the sota, but rather the different approaches (breadth) a the ultimate goals of the topic (depth). 

Ideally, I would like to;
* question some of the basic assumptions and definitions,
* find alternate interpretations,
* be able to answer; "what problem does it solve/what makes it hard?",
* develop intuition for the topic.

### Assesment

* Readings. Four papers summarised and explained in simple terms, pictures, pseudo-code and proofs with annotations.
* Assignments. Ready for public viewing (proof read, tidied, ...)
* Questions. Answered, with sources, proofs and/or experiments to validate.

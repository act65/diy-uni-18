Some courses I plan on doing/have done.

### Content and focus

A broad and deep view of each topic. Not necessarily focusing on the sota, but rather the different approaches (breadth) a the ultimate goals of the topic (depth). 

Ideally, I would like to;
* question some of the basic assumption and definitions,
* find alternate interpretations,
* develop intuition for the topic.

### Assesment

* Readings. Summarised and explained in simple terms.
* Assignments. Ready for public viewing (proof read, tidied, ...)
* Questions. Answered, with sources, proofs and/or experiments to validate.
